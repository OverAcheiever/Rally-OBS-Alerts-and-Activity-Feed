# Installation and Getting Started

## Donation Alerts

- Extract the zip file to a safe location on your PC. [Installing [WinRar](https://www.win-rar.com/postdownload.html?&L=0) would help with this step if not already installed]
- In OBS, add a new Browser Source by checking the Local file checkbox and then navigating to the location where you extracted the folder and selecting **Activity Feed**. Then click OK.
- After Setting up the Activity Feed following the below instructions, change the Creator Coin under the Activity Feed Settings. Additional visual customisation can be found there (Note: Any changes made to the custom fields only reflect in the alerts when reloaded. To reload keep the browser source selected and find the Refresh button in the menu at the center of the screen)
## Activity Feed
